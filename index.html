				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<hr/>

				<p>I am Andie. I am a 28 year old woman. I am a wife to my husband Sunny. I am a mom to two toddler daughters. I know how to get around to playing multiple music instruments, such as the guitar, both alto and tenor saxophones, the trombone and the flute. During high school, my love for music deepened and I felt that learning to play instruments would only further my passion and understanding for the music I enjoy to listen to so much. I come across a handful of people who find the idea of playing music instruments intimidating due to having to read the sheet music and having to remember where your notes are on the instruments. However, I always found it fascinating how, after a while, I didn't even need to think about where my fingers were going as my brain would automatically do it for me. This allowed me to know that trait about myself. After repeating the same combinations several times, my brain memorizes them and I can easily process that information without a single bump.</p>

				<p>Now, in my adult life, I find it easier to apply the same process to a grander scheme of things. Coding for example... after repeating the same lines of code time after time, my fingers just dance with the keystrokes without me having to think about how I need to type such and such command, it flows seamlessly.</p>
